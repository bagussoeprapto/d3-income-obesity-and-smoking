          <h2>High percentage of obesity and smokers are affecting states with lower median income</h2>
          <p>Based on the data provided by latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the 
            Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, states with lower median income have higher 
            percentage of obesity and smokers. In the scatter plot above, each circle represents each 
            state and its location on the graph shows the relationship between the state's median income 
            and percentage of obesity or smokers in that state.</p>

          <p>Arkansas (AK), West Virginia (WV), and Mississippi (MS) have the lowest median income 
            and the highest obesity percentage, 35.9%, 35.7%, and 35.5% respectively. These 3 states 
            also on the top 6 states that have a high smokerâ€™s percentage; WV is number one with 26.7%, 
            AK is on the third place with 24.7%, and MS is on the sixth place with 23% of its residence smoke.</p>

          <p>Obesity is an epidemic in the US. This condition puts people at a higher risk for serious 
            diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Smoking is also harmful for the body and causes 
            respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer. Further research is needed to understand the 
            cause of these harmful condition and behaviors, whether it is because of the limited option due 
            to residence's purchasing power or these areas are receiving less access to healthy lifestyle options.</p>
